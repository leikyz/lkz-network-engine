Fast and efficient networking solution built on UDP, designed for real-time applications.
It features an advanced event-driven system that ensures optimal message handling with minimal latency.

Currently adapted for my personal project for my final year as a student.

The goal is to create the most efficient and scalable system possible, using the best networking technologies from both Windows and Linux.
